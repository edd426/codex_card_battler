# Test Infrastructure Improvements

## Key Improvements

1. **Automated Server Management**
   - Created `setupTests.js` to automatically start/stop the server for tests
   - This eliminates the need to manually start the server before running tests
   - All tests can now run in CI/CD pipelines without modifications

2. **Jest Configuration**
   - Added a dedicated `jest.config.js` file with appropriate settings
   - Increased test timeout to accommodate socket.io tests
   - Added `forceExit` and `detectOpenHandles` flags to ensure clean test runs

3. **Specialized Test Commands**
   - Added `test:api` for API-related tests only
   - Added `test:pvp` for PvP-related tests only
   - Main `test` command now runs all tests with proper configuration

4. **Documentation**
   - Added this document to explain the changes
   - Added a test README to describe the test structure
   - Updated main README and CLAUDE.md with new test commands
   - Added inline comments in test files for clarity

## Remaining Issues

1. **Socket Test Failures**
   - Some socket.io tests still fail due to timing or race conditions
   - These would require more extensive test refactoring to fix
   - Consider using mock socket.io implementation for these tests

2. **Test Isolation**
   - Current tests might have interdependencies due to shared server
   - Consider running tests in isolation or using separate ports for each test

## Future Improvements

1. **Containerized Testing**
   - Consider running tests in Docker to ensure consistent environment

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Identify and fill gaps in test coverage

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize test execution time by running tests in parallel
   - Use connection pooling for socket tests

4. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on every PR
   - Block PRs with failing tests
