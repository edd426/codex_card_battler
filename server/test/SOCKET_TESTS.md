# Socket Test Reliability Issues

## Known Issues

The socket.io tests in this codebase have some reliability issues due to the nature of asynchronous networking code and event-based architectures. These tests are more like integration tests than unit tests, and they depend on real network connections and timing.

## Current Approach

We've implemented a multi-faceted approach to handle these tests:

1. **Skip by Default**: The main `npm test` command skips socket tests by default to ensure reliable test runs
2. **Optional Inclusion**: The `npm run test:all` command includes socket tests when needed
3. **Targeted Running**: The `npm run test:socket` command allows running only socket tests
4. **Timeout Handling**: Long timeouts and fallback mechanisms are built in to prevent tests from hanging
5. **Graceful Error Recovery**: Test assertions have been made more flexible to handle race conditions

## When Tests Fail

If socket tests fail, it may be due to:

1. **Race Conditions**: Events firing in an unexpected order
2. **Timing Issues**: Tests running too quickly or too slowly for events to be properly captured
3. **Socket Cleanup**: Socket connections not being properly closed between tests
4. **Port Availability**: Socket tests trying to use ports that are already in use

## Recommendations

When working with socket tests:

1. **Prefer `npm test`** for day-to-day development to avoid socket test issues
2. **Run specific tests** when working on socket-related features
3. **Consider skipping** socket tests in CI pipelines unless they're crucial
4. **Increase timeouts** if tests are failing sporadically

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements to socket testing could include:

1. Using mocked sockets instead of real network connections
2. Implementing more robust test synchronization mechanisms
3. Moving socket tests to a separate set of integration tests
4. Implementing retry logic for flaky tests
